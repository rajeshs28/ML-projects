I worked on a machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal was to accurately identify suspicious activity using real-world datasets. I applied data preprocessing techniques, explored patterns using visualization, and built predictive models using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.
